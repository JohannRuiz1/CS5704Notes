### Process module:
Made up of Umbrella Activities (done throughout the project, ex. Project Management), and Framework Activities, where they have  a list of actions with steps

### Framework Activities:
1) Communication -> Requirements Gathering
2) Planning -> Estimation and scheduling
3) Modeling -> Analysis and design
4) Construction -> Coding and testing
5) Deployment -> Delivery and feedback

Linear = Waterfall Model

Problems: Projects aren't really sequential, customer out of loop, mistakes not detected quickly
Improvements:
1) Build a prototype
2) Document your design
3) Use good testing techniques
4) Involve the customer

### Maintenance

Most time consuming step is **Maintenance**, takes up around 60% software lifecycle
Testing is the second most, 16%, everything else is 8%

##### Reasons for Maintenance
- Adaptive maintenance - adapting software to new environment (OS updates) (18%)
- Corrective maintenance - bug fixing (17%)
- Modifications - adding new features (cause customer) (60%)
- Preventive maintenance - improve designs (refactoring) (5%)

##### 60/60 Rule: 60% of software is maintenance, and 60% of maintenance is modifications


### Prototyping
Helps understand requirements, user interface, and architecture 

### Spiral Model
![[SpiralModel.png]]
Risk driven
Misconception: it's a sequence of waterfall, and every activity must be executed

### Unified Process Model 
Characteristics
1) Use-case driven
2) Architecture centric
3) Iterative
4) Aligned with UML
